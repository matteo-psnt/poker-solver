# Default Plus Research Configuration
# Balanced between speed and accuracy with more precompute time and similer training
# Estimated precomputation time: ~15-20 minutes

# Board clustering (public-state abstraction)
board_clusters:
  flop: 50    # 50 clusters × 1 rep × ~450 hands = ~22.5k equity computations
  turn: 100   # 100 clusters × 1 rep × ~450 hands = ~45k equity computations
  river: 200  # 200 clusters × 1 rep × ~450 hands = ~90k equity computations

# Representatives per cluster (for equity computation)
representatives_per_cluster: 3

# Equity buckets per street
