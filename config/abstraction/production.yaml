# Production Configuration
# High-quality abstraction for serious training
# Estimated precomputation time: ~1-2 hours

# Board clustering (public-state abstraction)
board_clusters:
  flop: 100   # 100 clusters × 2 reps × ~450 hands = ~90k equity computations
  turn: 200   # 200 clusters × 2 reps × ~450 hands = ~180k equity computations
  river: 400  # 400 clusters × 2 reps × ~450 hands = ~360k equity computations

# Representatives per cluster (for equity computation)
representatives_per_cluster: 3

# Equity buckets per street
buckets:
  flop: 100
  turn: 300
  river: 600

# Equity calculation settings

# Clustering algorithm settings
kmeans_max_iter: 500
kmeans_n_init: 20

# System settings
