# Default Configuration for HUNLHE Solver
# Heads-Up No-Limit Hold'em Monte Carlo CFR Solver

# ===== Game Configuration =====
game:
  starting_stack: 200  # BB units
  small_blind: 1
  big_blind: 2

# ===== Action Abstraction =====
# Research-grade abstraction for 200BB deep-stack HUNLHE
# Based on standard CFR research (Johanson et al., Brown & Sandholm, DeepStack)
action_abstraction:
  # Preflop betting sizes (in BB units)
  # No all-in preflop at 200BB (almost never correct)
  preflop:
    raises: [2.5, 3.5, 5.0]  # Range construction sizes

  # Postflop betting sizes (pot fractions, street-dependent)
  postflop:
    flop:
      bets: [0.33, 0.66, 1.25]  # Range bet, standard, overbet
    turn:
      bets: [0.50, 1.0, 1.5]  # Medium, pot, large overbet
    river:
      bets: [0.50, 1.0, 2.0]  # Thin value, pot, large overbet

  # All-in handling: Only allowed when SPR < 2
  all_in_spr_threshold: 2.0  # Disable all-in above this SPR

# ===== Card Abstraction =====
card_abstraction:
  type: "equity_bucketing"

  # Path to precomputed equity bucketing file
  # Must be generated using "Precompute Equity Buckets" in CLI
  bucketing_path: "data/abstractions/equity_buckets.pkl"

# ===== SPR Bucketing =====
spr_buckets:
  # Thresholds for [shallow/medium, medium/deep]
  thresholds: [4, 13]

# ===== Solver Configuration =====
solver:
  type: "mccfr"
  variant: "outcome_sampling"  # Options: "outcome_sampling", "external_sampling"

# ===== Training Configuration =====
training:
  num_iterations: 1000
  checkpoint_frequency: 100  # Save checkpoint every N iterations
  log_frequency: 10  # Print progress every N iterations
  checkpoint_dir: "data/checkpoints"
  verbose: true

# ===== Storage Configuration =====
storage:
  backend: "disk"  # Options: "memory", "disk"
  cache_size: 100000  # LRU cache size for disk backend
  flush_frequency: 1000  # Flush dirty infosets every N iterations

# ===== System Configuration =====
system:
  seed: null  # Random seed (null = random)
  log_level: "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
