# Example Training Configuration (New Config-Based System)
# This demonstrates the new abstraction config reference system

# ===== Game Configuration =====
game:
  starting_stack: 200
  small_blind: 1
  big_blind: 2

# ===== Action Abstraction =====
action_abstraction:
  preflop:
    raises: [2.5, 3.5, 5.0]
  postflop:
    flop:
      bets: [0.33, 0.66, 1.25]
    turn:
      bets: [0.50, 1.0, 1.5]
    river:
      bets: [0.50, 1.0, 2.0]
  all_in_spr_threshold: 2.0

# ===== Card Abstraction =====
card_abstraction:
  type: "equity_bucketing"

  # NEW: Reference equity bucket config by name
  # This will:
  # 1. Load config/equity_buckets/production.yaml
  # 2. Check if already precomputed (by config hash)
  # 3. If not found, prompt user to compute
  config: production

  # OLD: Direct file path (still supported for backward compatibility)
  # bucketing_path: "data/equity_buckets/buckets-F50T100R200-C200C500C1000-s1000-2a0e3c/abstraction.pkl"

# ===== SPR Bucketing =====
spr_buckets:
  thresholds: [4, 13]

# ===== Solver Configuration =====
solver:
  type: "mccfr"
  sampling_method: "external"
  cfr_plus: true
  linear_cfr: true

# ===== Training Configuration =====
training:
  num_iterations: 100000
  checkpoint_frequency: 10000
  log_frequency: 1000
  runs_dir: "data/runs"  # Changed from checkpoint_dir
  verbose: true

# ===== Storage Configuration =====
storage:
  backend: "disk"
  cache_size: 100000
  flush_frequency: 1000

# ===== System Configuration =====
system:
  seed: null
  log_level: "INFO"
  config_name: "baseline"  # Name for this training config

# Available equity bucket configs in config/equity_buckets/:
# - production: High-quality (50/100/200 buckets)
# - fast_test: Quick test (10/20/30 buckets)
# - Or create your own YAML in config/equity_buckets/
