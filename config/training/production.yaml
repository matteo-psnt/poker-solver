# Production Training Configuration for HUNLHE Solver
# Optimized for creating viable GTO strategies with CFR+
#
# Expected training time with CFR+:
# - 100M iterations: ~8 hours (single core) or ~1-2 hours (8 cores parallel)
# - 1B iterations: ~3.6 days (single core) or ~12-18 hours (8 cores parallel)
#
# Convergence targets (with CFR+):
# - 10M iterations: ~50-100 mbb/g exploitability (weak amateur)
# - 100M iterations: ~10-20 mbb/g exploitability (decent player)
# - 1B iterations: ~1-5 mbb/g exploitability (good player)
